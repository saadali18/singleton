# Singleton

The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful in scenarios where you want to limit the number of instances of a class to exactly one, such as when you want to control access to a shared resource or when you need a global object that can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
